    <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love!</h1>

    <p>My Dearest, Insha</p>
    <p>On your special day, I want to take a moment to remind you of just how incredibly special you are to me. You have a heart so pure, and a spirit that, despite all the battles you've faced, continues to shine brighter than any star in the sky. I know life hasnâ€™t always been easy for you, and Iâ€™ve seen you struggle through so much, but youâ€™ve always remained strong, graceful, and full of love.</p>
    <p>I admire your strength, your resilience, and your ability to face each day with so much courage, even when the weight of the world seems unbearable. Thereâ€™s no pain you canâ€™t endure, no challenge you canâ€™t overcome. You are truly amazing, and Iâ€™m in awe of everything you are.</p>
 <p>But more than anything, I want you to know this: no matter what you go through, no matter how hard things get, I am here. I am always here. In the quiet moments, in the chaos, in the darkness and the light,I'm by your side, holding you, loving you, and supporting you every single step of the way. Your heart will never have to carry its burdens alone because I am yours, forever.</p>
<p>Today, I celebrate youâ€”not just the beautiful woman you are, but the incredible strength that resides in you, the love you give so freely, and the warmth you bring into this world. You deserve all the happiness, peace, and love in the world, and I promise I will do everything I can to be the one who gives that to you.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, my love. You are my everything, and I will always stand by you, no matter what.</p>

    <div class="footer">
        <p>Forever yours, Yasir Zaidi (Bhola baccha)</p>
